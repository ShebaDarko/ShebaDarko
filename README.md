**About Me**

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sheba Darko, an MSc Computer Science and Applied Mathematics graduate specializing in data science. I love diving into projects that involve machine learning, cybersecurity, and data analysis. While I'm still learning and exploring, I've already tackled a bunch of cool projects that I'm excited to share with you!

**What I Do**

- **Exploring Machine Learning:** I'm fascinated by the world of machine learning and enjoy tinkering with algorithms to see what they can do.

- **Cybersecurity Curiosity:** I'm always curious about cybersecurity and how we can make machine learning models more secure against sneaky attacks.

- **Analyzing Data:** From digging into Excel spreadsheets to creating interactive dashboards in Power BI, I love analyzing data and uncovering interesting insights.

- **Simulating Scenarios:** Whether it's simulating a stock market crash or modeling the spread of a virus, I enjoy using MATLAB to simulate real-world scenarios.

**My Projects**

- **Machine Learning Adventures:** Come check out some of my machine learning projects, from predicting house prices to recommending movies!

- **Cybersecurity Explorations:** Dive into my cybersecurity projects where I've tried to defend machine learning models from cyber threats.

- **Data Analysis Fun:** Take a peek at my data analysis projects where I've explored everything from sales trends to social media sentiment analysis.

- **Simulated Worlds:** Join me in exploring the simulated worlds I've created in MATLAB, from financial simulations to engineering scenarios.
